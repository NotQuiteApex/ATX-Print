# Full ATX PC Case
My custom designed and 3D printed PC case, housing a full ATX motherboard, ATX PSU, 120mm fans, and a Coolermaster 240mm AIO. Features full PCIe slots and support for <285mm GPUs. There is also an alternate version for SFX power supplies.

I designed this case from the ground up based on any and all available documentation on the standard specs for ATX parts. The main case body is to be printed in 4 parts because of the size limitations of my Ender 3 Pro 3D printer, which can only print 235x235x300mm^3. The STEP files included are the original parts, designed in Autodesk Inventor 2021. The SCAD files in the repo are meant to be a recreation of the parts in an open format that is easy to edit and export for free (no licensing for Autodesk software) and thus are a Work-in-Progress.

If you would like to print the current version, look at the README inside the STEP folder. It includes instructions on printing and assembly.
